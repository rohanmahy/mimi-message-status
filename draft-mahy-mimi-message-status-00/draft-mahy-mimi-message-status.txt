1.  Introduction

   This document describes the semantics of a status report of MIMI
   content format [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] messages.  Because some
   messaging systems deliver messages in batches and allow a user to
   mark several messages read at a time, the report format allows a
   single report to convey the read/delivered status of multiple
   messages (by message ID) within the same MIMI room at a time.  This
   specification defines a concise, efficient format for communicating
   status of messages sent using MIMI content.  It could also represent
   messages sent using other messaging formats that have similar per-
   message unique message IDs and security characteristics.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the term "room" as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch].

3.  Delivery Reporting and Read Receipts

   In instant messaging systems, read receipts typically generate a
   distinct indicator for each message.  In some systems, the number of
   users in a group who have read the message is subtly displayed and
   the list of users who read the message is available on further
   inspection.

   Of course, Internet mail has support for read receipts as well, but
   the existing message disposition notification mechanism defined for
   email in [RFC8098] is completely inappropriate in this context:

   *  notifications can be sent by intermediaries

   *  only one notification can be sent about a single message per
      recipient

   *  a human-readable version of the notification is expected

   *  each notification can refer to only one message

   *  it is extremely verbose

   Instead, we would like to be able to include status changes about
   multiple messages in each report, the ability to mark a message
   delivered, then read, then unread, then expired for example.

   The format, like the MIMI content format, uses Common Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR) [RFC8949] encoding.  It has the media type
   application/mimi-message-status.  It is sent by individual members of
   a chat room and can refer to multiple messages sent in the same room
   in a single message.  The format contains a list of message ID /
   status pairs.  As the status at the recipient changes, the status can
   be updated in subsequent notification.

   The status of each message can be one of the following values:

   *  0 (unread) indicates that the message was not yet read by the
      sender of the report.

   *  1 (delivered) indicates that a messaging client of the sender of
      the report received the message.

   *  2 (read) indicates that the sender of the report read the message.

   *  3 (expired) indicates that the message expired and is not
      available for reading.  In the case of absolute expiration, it
      does not indicate if the message was read before its expiry.

   *  4 (deleted) indicates that the message was deleted, either by the
      local client, or by another member of the room with the power to
      retract messages.

   *  5 (hidden) indicates that the message was hidden by the local
      client (for example archived).

   *  6 (error) indicates that the sender client is aware of the message
      ID, but that there was an unspecified error with the reception of
      the message.

   Not every state is relevant for every type of message, and it does
   not make sense to transition from any one state to any other state.
   For example, a transition from deleted to delivered does not make
   sense.  The implementer of this format needs to decide which state
   transitions are meaningful given their implementation and its
   available policy options.

   Depending on the policy of the room and a potential sender of
   delivery reports, sending delivery receipts and/or read receipt
   messages might be required, optional, or forbidden.  Clients might
   also have policies about specific status values that are shared and
   others that are not.  Some status values might only be shared among
   the reporting user's own clients, for example.

4.  Formal Data Definition

   Below is the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610]
   definition for the message status format.

   MessageStatusReport = [ * PerMessageStatus ]

   PerMessageStatus = [
       messageId: MessageId,
       status: baseStatus / $extStatus / unknownStatus
   ]

   baseStatus = &(
       unread: 0,
       delivered: 1,
       read: 2,
       expired: 3,
       deleted: 4,
       hidden: 5,
       error: 6
   )
   unknownStatus = &( unknown: 7..255 )

   MessageId = bstr .size 32

               Figure 1: CDDL for MIMI message status format

5.  Message Status Format Example

   The following example message assumes the sender user handle URL is
   mimi://example.com/u/bob-jones.

   It uses the example message names and message IDs from Section 5 of
   the MIMI content [I-D.ietf-mimi-content].

   [
     [
       /  Original message     /
       h'01b0084467273cc43d6f0ebeac13eb84
         229c4fffe8f6c3594c905f47779e5a79',
       2    / status = read    /
     ],
     [
       /  Reply message        /
       h'01a419aef4e16d43cfc06c28235ecfbe
         9faebc740d0148e7ca20b22150930836',
       2    / status = read    /
     ],
     [
       /  Mention message      /
       h'01cbc26869928fd13edf55ace00f9976
         8ca4e62ad17fede45520eaca58f69d02',
       0    / status = unread  /
     ],
     [
       /  Expiring message     /
       h'0106308e2c03346eba95b24abdfa9fe6
         43aa247debfb7192feae647155316920',
       3    / status = expired /
     ]
   ]

6.  Security Considerations

   Delivery and Read Receipts can provide useful information inside a
   group, or they can reveal sensitive private information.  In many IM
   systems there are per-group policies for read receipts (and/or
   delivery notifications):

   *  they are required

   *  they are permitted, but optional

   *  they are forbidden

   In the first case, everyone in the group would have to claim to
   support read receipts to be in the group and agree to the policy of
   sending them whenever a message was read.  A user who did not wish to
   send read receipts could review the policy (automatically or
   manually) and choose not to join the group.  Of course, requiring
   read receipts is a cooperative effort just like using self-deleting
   messages.  A malicious client could obviously read a message and not
   send a read receipt, or send a read receipt for a message that was
   never rendered.  However, cooperating clients have a way to agree
   that they will send read receipts when a message is read in a
   specific group.

   In the second case, sending a read receipt would be at the discretion
   of each receiver of the message (via local preferences).
